# Gen-AI-Image-Caption-Generator
Generative AI has revolutionized computer vision and natural language processing by enabling Image
captioning, a crucial task in artificial intelligence, bridges the gap between computer vision and natural
language processing by generating meaningful textual descriptions of visual content. This project
introduces a “Generative AI-based Image Caption Generator for Scene Analysis”, leveraging
advanced Python , PyTorch and Transformer-based architectures like Vision-Language Models for
caption generation. The system is designed to interpret complex visual scenes, generate meaningful
descriptions, and enhance accessibility in applications like surveillance, autonomous driving, crime
detection , forensic and assistive technologies. The model is trained on diverse datasets to improve
accuracy, coherence, and contextual understanding. This project aims to bridge the gap between visual
perception and linguistic expression, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven scene comprehension
